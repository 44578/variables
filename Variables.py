print("Hello world")
#Instead of refering to the = sign as "equals", it is called assigned 
first_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
#The first name is a variable, and is created based on the user's input 
print(first_name)
#This command prints the variable created earlier
print("Hi {0}!".format(first_name))
#Finally, another command is added to the variable which produces a sentence
